<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">"Come</span>, May, come, Nellie; hurry up. Deacon Fitney will be here
directly and the train starts directly."</p>

<p>The voice was that of Mr. Trevellyan, a thoroughly well-known and
highly respected stock broker of the City of Chicago. Mr. Trevellyan was
a hard-working man, and his various affairs did not give him much opportunity
of absenting himself from his business. But to-day had been laid out as a holiday
for the babies, and papa Trevellyan had made up his mind to take part in it.</p>

<p>After a good deal of family discussion [these things generally involve more
or less of that sort of thing] it was finally decided to make a trip to Niagara
Falls and back. So a party was made up which was to consist of Mr. and Mrs.
Trevellyan, the two children and a good-hearted Deacon Fitney, who was
well acquainted with the way to "do" the Falls properly.</p>

<p>The day was, as I have just said, a bright one, even for the month of June,
and both May and Nellie, in anticipation of a pleasant time, were not long in
putting on their things and repairing to the parlor.</p>

<p>It was well they hurried. There was papa, valise in hand, ready to start;
mamma, too, and nothing seemed to be wanting but the presence of Deacon
Fitney, who had gone off to secure the railway tickets, and who promised to
return at once with a carriage and accompany the whole party to the train.
The Deacon was not long in coming back. He was a good man in his way, was
the Deacon. He had only one fault&mdash;he was unreasonably fond of Buttons!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
He adorned his apparel with more buttons than even the law requires, and he
wore a nice gold headed button on his neatly tied satin scarf. Nobody could
ever find out what prompted this peculiarity, but then nobody seemed to care
very much. However, as I said before, the Deacon came back very quickly and
helped get things in the carriage.</p>

<p>"By the way, Deacon," said Mr. Trevellyan, "what time do we start and
which way do we go? You know I have left everything of that kind to you."</p>

<p>"Four-thirty," said the Deacon, in a cheerful sort of way, "and by the
Michigan Central Railroad. It is the only way to go. But never mind about
the advantages to be gained by going over this remarkable route. I will tell
you all about it when we get on the train."</p>

<p>And so they bundled into the carriage, and within a few minutes the entire
party was seated in one of the magnificent palace cars which are attached to the
Michigan Central Limited Express.</p>

<p>"All aboard!" shouted the conductor. "We're off," smiled the Deacon.
The big clock in the depot struck the half after four, and the magnificent train
composed of five sleepers, three coaches, a palace dining car and a couple of
baggage cars, slowly pulled out of the station.</p>

<p>May and Nellie glued their noses to the window, and their delight as they
whizzed through the beautiful suburbs of South Chicago, seemed unbounded.
With Lake Michigan, tranquil and glittering with the rays of a summer sun, on
one side, and a succession of lovely suburban residences on the other, the
sight was a most lovely one. A few minutes later the train was flying through
green fields and beautiful woods.</p>

<p>"Here, children," suddenly cried the Deacon from the other side of the
car, "come quick and see the magic city of Pullman." In a minute May was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
one of the Deacon's knees and Nellie on the other, and the train passed rapidly
by the most wonderful evidence of modern enterprise.</p>

<p>"Three years ago," said the Deacon, in answer to an enquiring look of
admiration in the children's eyes, "the ground on which stands this most beautiful
city, which is without doubt the model city of the world, was nothing but a
swamp. See what it is now. Some day, when we get back home, I will bring
you here and let you learn more closely what the creator of the beautiful place
which bears the name of Pullman has done for his country."</p>

<p>A minute later the train flew past Kensington, and then fairly started on its
iron way for its first stopping place, Michigan City, better known as the City of
Sand. Then came Niles, with its wonderful bridge and its fairy valley. Then
Kalamazoo, the biggest village in the world, and the flower bed of creation.
Then Marshall, Battle Creek and Jackson, the latter place the centre of railway
industry of the beautiful State of Michigan. Then Ann Arbor, where is situated
the University of the State of Michigan, and then, last, but not least, Detroit.</p>

<p>By this time, of course, the babies had been tucked in bed. The Deacon
had taken them into the dining car and feasted them with all the inexhaustible
luxuries for which these cars on the Michigan Central R.R. are so famous.</p>

<p>Then the colored porter having made up their beds they were soon fast
asleep and dreaming of the treat in store for the morrow.</p>

<p>The Deacon, however, was determined at least that his grown-up friends
should lose none of the beauties of the trip, and so he insisted that Mr. and Mrs.
Trevellyan should remain up until they had crossed the famous Detroit River.
The night was a beautiful one, and they were amply rewarded by witnessing one
of the most thoroughly picturesque pieces of scenery in the world. The entire
train was placed on one of the immense ferry steamers, and the landing shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
afterwards made at Windsor, a picturesque and quaint little town on the Canadian
side of the river. At this point commences the Canada Southern Division of the
Michigan Central Railroad, famous alike for the magnificence of its equipment
and smoothness of track. Here our friends, so to speak, turned in, and it was
only a few minutes before every one on board was fast asleep.</p>

<p>The next thing was the morning sun and Niagara Falls. The run had been
made from Chicago in the remarkable time of fifteen hours.</p>

<p>"Oh, how good of you, Deacon Fitney," said little May a short while later,
as standing on a verandah of Joe &mdash;&mdash; House, she gazed with rapture at the
Falls in all their splendor; "how good of you to bring us to such a nice place
and by such a delightful road."</p>

<p>"I am glad you like it," said the Deacon, with a smile; "but you must
not credit me with too much goodness, for I could hardly have brought you by
any other way. The Michigan Central road is the only direct road running to
the Falls, and you could hardly expect that I could take you there by any line
which is not entirely the best."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Trevellyan heartily joined May in her expressions of thanks
to the Deacon, and more than endorsed every word he had said in praise of the
wonderful Michigan Central Limited Express.</p>

<p>They spent the day at the Falls&mdash;a day of merry sunshine and happiness.
The Falls never looked grander and nature never smiled with more sweetness.
The time passed only too quickly, and when the children stepped on the cars
once more to return to Chicago it was with a twinge of regret which was only
offset by the knowledge that they had another delightful trip in store for them
on the Michigan Central Road.</p>

<p>Now May has the following time table hung up among her pictures on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
wall in her bed room. She says it serves to remind her of one of the happiest
days of her life. Above it, in a baby's handwriting, she has scrawled:</p>

<p class="center">"THE ONLY WAY TO GO EAST FROM CHICAGO IS BY THE
MICHIGAN CENTRAL R.R."

<p>This train, leaving Chicago one hour later than heretofore, makes a much
surer connection with Western lines.</p>

<p>The Smoking Car, Day Coach and one Sleeping Car run through to Buffalo
via M. C.; one Sleeping Car runs through to Toronto via M. C. and Credit Valley
Railways; one Sleeping Car runs through to New York via M. C. and N.
Y. C. The Dining Car serves dinner out of Chicago at 5 o'clock; train arrives
in Buffalo in good season for breakfast.</p>

<p>This train has attached at Detroit a Through Sleeping Car from St. Louis
to New York, via W., St. L. &amp; P., M. C. and N. Y. C., that makes quicker through
time than any other line; and also a Sleeping Car from Detroit to Syracuse that
is placed in Detroit depot about 9 p. m. Passengers can enter their berths any
time after that hour.</p>

<p>Connects with Grand Trunk trains in Detroit.</p>

<p>Connection with Pullman Car for New York and Philadelphia, via Erie,
leaving Buffalo at 9.15 a. m., and also with Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia,
leaving at 8.20 a. m.</p>

<p>Connects at Albany with through sleeper for Boston via B. &amp; A., leaving at
8.40 p. m.</p>

<p>No second class passengers are carried on this train.</p>

Express.</em></p>

<p>May's advice is very excellent. She says the Michigan Central is the best
road in the United States and she knows what she is talking about.</p>

<p class="center">CHICAGO AND NEW YORK.</p>

<p>The two cities above named are the great commercial centers of the
United States, the former containing in the vicinity of 650,000 inhabitants,
and the latter about 1,500,000. The number of people actually in Chicago
at any one time would doubtless range far above these figures, as its floating
or transient population is enormous, running up into figures that can hardly
be credited. The traffic passing between these two cities daily is very large
when one considers that they are within a fraction of 1,000 miles apart.
Boston also has a large traffic with Chicago, and to give an idea of the
accommodations necessary to provide for the passenger business alone
between the three cities, we may state that the</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_063.png" width="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Michigan Central Railroad,</div>
</div>
<p>which is the principal thoroughfare between the cities named, runs five
express trains daily&mdash;three on Sundays&mdash;made up of fine new day coaches,
smoking cars, drawing-room cars, palatial sleeping cars.</p>

<p>The Michigan Central Railroad has always held a foremost place
amongst the lines between Chicago and the Atlantic sea-board, and the
latest addition to their accommodations in the shape of four new Dining
Cars will greatly strengthen its position.</p>

<p>These new cars are incomparable for beauty of design and selectness
of adornments, all the elegancies of art having been exhausted to produce
the most desirable effect. That the end has been gained, goes without
saying, and they stand to-day as far in advance of other Dining Cars as the
first Dining Cars were in advance of the lunch counters at wayside stations.</p>

<p>The <em>cuisine</em> is quite on a par with the finish of the cars, and all that
may minister to the nourishment of the body, or tickle the palate of the
most discriminating epicures, will be found therein.</p>

<p>Other great features of the Michigan Central Railroad are that its
through trains for New York and Boston run out of Chicago along the
Michigan Lake front within a stone's throw of the city's costliest mansions,
through South Park and the magic city of Pullman, affording an extensive
survey of this marvel of a marvelous age, and later passing in full view of
Niagara Falls. It is for this latter reason known to all travelers as "The
Niagara Falls Route."</p>

</p>

<p>For more than <em>twenty years</em> this paint has been in general use by master mechanics, master car builders
and chief engineers upon the principal railroads in this country, who have pronounced it <em>superior</em> to
any paint they have ever used, for the many purposes to which it has been applied, viz.: For painting
<em>car roofs</em>, the <em>upper</em> face and <em>outside</em> of <em>car sills</em>, the <em>mortise</em> and <em>tenon</em> when building or repairing cars, the
<em>outside</em> of locomotive boilers before the lag is put on, the inside of <em>locomotive tanks</em> to protect the iron from
rust, the inside of <em>pits of tenders</em> to protect the iron from the injurious effects of the coal, <em>trucks</em>, <em>wheels</em>,
<em>bridge timbers</em>, <em>turn tables</em>, the <em>inside</em> of <em>station water tanks</em>, <em>roofs of buildings</em>, <em>etc.</em>, <em>etc.</em> It penetrates wood,
forming a body in the same, which <em>no other paint does</em>. Is <em>impervious</em> to <em>water</em>, and the <em>best preserver</em> known.</p>

<p>The foundation of this paint is <em>creosote</em>, which in its nature, is very <em>penetrating</em> and the best known
<em>preserver</em>. It is mixed ready for use, and <em>one gallon</em> of <em>this paint</em> will cover <em>twice</em> the <em>surface</em> of any other
paint in use. This paint is very extensively used for painting <em>vessel hulls</em>.</p>

</p>

<p>When possible, is, undoubtedly, a gem equal in value, in some respects, to the "pearl of
great price." It helped Job through some rough experiences. But it will be scarcely
available to most of the good people of this country when they come to know of the Royal
Arch grandeurs awaiting their enjoyment at the charming Summer Resorts in Wisconsin,
Minnesota and Iowa, where they are as thick as diamonds in Golconda all along the lines
of that <em>Great Bonanza Railway</em>, whose other name is</p>

<p class="ph2">CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE &amp; ST. PAUL,

</p>

<p>The reputation this theater has made for itself, and the fact that it is known as the pioneer Opera House in the West, render
it unnecessary to offer any extended description. While theaters have been erected, calculated to surpass in beauty and costliness
Tootle's Opera House, few, to-day, can legitimately claim equality, and none can surpass it in all that pertains to the arrangement
of a first-class place of amusement. The stage is 40 &times; 67, with an opening 34 &times; 35, and is furnished with a full complement
of scenery. Recently the house has been thoroughly renovated, repainted inside and outside, and re-carpeted; a new drop curtain
hung, and the apparatus for lighting the gas by electricity placed in the building; a new steam heating apparatus and the water
works connection are also among the improvements; capacity 1,500. Tootle's Opera House is located in the very center of a city
of 45,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>Formerly known as <em>The Topeka Opera House</em>, but, to avoid a conflict of titles, name changed to that of <span class="smcap">Grand Opera House</span>.</p>

<p>The house was built by a stock company; 300 residents financially interested; cost $60,000; capacity 1,500; stage is 60 &times; 67
feet; the proscenium opening is 35 &times; 38 feet; eight large dressing rooms; full complement of scenery; only ground floor Opera
House in the city; can be emptied in <em>one minute and a half</em>; absolute safety guaranteed to the patrons of the Grand; Topeka is the
capital of the State, and the principal city, commercially and politically; constantly thronged with strangers; resident population
about 27,000. Messrs. Wood &amp; Updegraff are the local managers, but all communications should be addressed to Mr. Craig, at
St. Joseph, Mo.</p>

<p class="center">THE GILLIS OPERA HOUSE, KANSAS CITY, MO.
</p>

<p>This elegant theater, rapidly approaching completion, is being erected under the provisions of a will which requires <em>that the
net earnings of the house shall be applied to the maintenance of a permanent home for destitute children</em>, and will be opened early
in September, 1883. When completed, the Gillis Opera House will have cost $100,000. It is centrally located, being within four
blocks of twelve hotels. Nearly every street-car line in the city passes its doors, either on Fifth or Walnut streets. It is therefore
evident that the Gillis has a decided advantage of location for the resident as well as the transient population. All appointments
of auditorium first-class; means of exit ample&mdash;three entrances on ground floor, and two spacious staircases, each 20 ft.
wide. The stage of the Gillis is one of the largest in the country, 42 &times; 124 ft.; height of scenery 28 ft.; height above scenery 32 ft.;
proscenium opening 37 &times; 46 ft.; seventeen dressing rooms, green room, reception room and music room. <em>First-class</em> attractions
can safely book a week at the Gillis, and none other need apply; 109 nights already booked. Population upwards of 100,000.</p>

<p class="center">SPECIAL NOTICE.
</p>

<p>SPIES &amp; SMART, 12 Union Square, N.Y., are my accredited agents, and at all times the open time at the Gillis, Tootle's,
and the Grand can be found on file at their office. I shall be there until June 20.</p>
